# Installing Python
First, check whether Python is installed on your system. Open a command window by entering command into the Start menu or by holding down the SHIFT key while right-clicking on your desktop and selecting Open command window here from the menu. 

In the terminal window, enter python in lowercase. If you get a Python (>>>) in response, Pyhton is installed on your system. If you see an error message telling you that python is not a recognized command, Python isn't installed.
